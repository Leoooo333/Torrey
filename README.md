# Torrey

A CPU path tracer renderer, project from UCSD [CSE 168](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tzli/cse168/ ).

Torrey is set up only based on a little of necessary library. We have implemented lots of rendering algorithms and materials in it. For our technical details, check our [report](../../assets/pdf/report.pdf).

# Build & Run

See `README_ori.md` for details.

## My digital signature

The balls is generated by a python script. It is randomly assigned a material between `glass` and `mirror`.

## Easy Volume

A easy version volume spheres in Cornell box.

## Cats' Secret

These sphere are `area light` inside and covered by a transparent material with different texture. The atmosphere is implemented by several layers of `volume`material.

## Image-based Rendering

From left to right: `mirror`, `plastic`,`glass`(eta=1.5), and `microfacet`(roughness=800)

## Cheers!

These are our final results for Torrey! The water, bubbles are `glass` with different IOR. We have also included normal map in every material. In addition to the environment light, a area light is applied when necessary.
